## 🌀 Curve Shot (Spin Effect)
* Adds a realistic spin effect to the ball when kicked, using the `node-haxball` library.
* The curve direction depends on the player's and ball's Y position when shooting — higher or lower positions create different spin trajectories.

### ⚙️ Features
* Basic spin effect based on player Y position.
* Adjustable and compatible with `node-haxball` physics.

### 🧠 Notes
* Implementation inspired by classic HaxBall curve mechanics, enhancing gameplay dynamics and realism.
